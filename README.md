Provides a **Sharing Sheet** on iOS & iPadOS and a **Sharing Menu** on macOS in a SwiftUI fashion that allows the user to share a piece of data using the **Sharing Options** available on the device the app is running on.

## Support

If you find `SwiftUiSharing` useful and would like to help support its continued development and maintenance, please consider making a small donation, especially if you are using it in a commercial product:

It's through the support of contributors like yourself, I can continue to build, release and maintain high-quality, well documented Swift Packages like `SwiftUiSharing` for free.

<a name="Installation"></a>
## Installation

**Swift Package Manager** (Xcode 11 and above)

1. In Xcode, select the **File** > **Add Package Dependencyâ€¦** menu item.
2. Paste `https://github.com/Appracatappra/SwiftUiSharing.git` in the dialog box.
3. Follow the Xcode's instruction to complete the installation.

> Why not CocoaPods, or Carthage, or blank?

Supporting multiple dependency managers makes maintaining a library exponentially more complicated and time consuming.

Since, the **Swift Package Manager** is integrated with Xcode 11 (and greater), it's the easiest choice to support going further.

## iOS Example

Here's an example of using `SwiftUiSharing` on  iOS/iPadOS:

 ```swift
 Button(action: {
     SharingSheet.openMarkdownPrintSheet(markdown: dataStore.allShoppingLists(asMarkdown:true), simpleText: dataStore.allShoppingLists(), fromX: 245.0, fromY: 32.0)
 }) {
     Image(systemName: "square.and.arrow.up")
         .resizable()
         .foregroundColor(Color("AccentColor"))
 }
 .frame(width: 24.0, height: 24.0)
 .help("Share your Shopping Lists")
 ```

Which looks like this on iOS:
